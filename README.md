## Introduction

Hi! My name is Austin Lively, and I'm a Computer Science and Electrical/Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Tulsa, minoring in Math, Cyber Security, and High Performance Computing. I love working with computers on all levels, from circuit work to high level software. My interests are in Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence, and Automation.
